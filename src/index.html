            Hello, I am a aspiring software developer who is passionate about creating
            visually appealing, responsive webpages that work efficiently. I am currently 
            a student at RRC Polytech in the BIT program. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On my free time I enjoy being active in a myriad of ways. Playing basketball, 
            exercising at the gym, and hiking are things I try to incorporate at least a 
            few times during the week. I also enjoying reading and cooking.
